# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Summary of Processes

OctoAcme employs a structured, customer-centric project management lifecycle designed to convert business needs into high-quality software through iterative delivery. The process is organized into five core stages: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. During Initiation, the focus is on validating the business need and aligning stakeholders via a "Project One-pager." This moves into a rigorous Planning phase where work is broken down into prioritized backlogs with clear acceptance criteria and a "Definition of Done," ensuring that all team members and stakeholders have a shared understanding of success.

The Execution phase is driven by a consistent team rhythm, including daily standups and weekly delivery syncs, managed through a visual project board. Quality assurance is integrated directly into this workflow, requiring small pull requests with mandatory automated testing, security scanning, and at least one peer approval. This ensures that quality is not an afterthought but a continuous part of the development cycle. Risk management is also a proactive element, with a dedicated Risk Register used to track, assess, and mitigate potential blockers throughout the project lifecycle.

Communication strategies are tiered to ensure transparency across all levels of the organization. This includes weekly syncs between Project Managers and Product Managers, monthly stakeholder updates, and a clear escalation path for blockers that moves from the team level up to executive sponsors. Roles are clearly defined to support this structure: Product Managers own the "what" and "why," Project Managers coordinate the "how" and "when," and Developers focus on implementation and maintainability.

Finally, the process emphasizes continuous improvement through structured Retrospectives held after major milestones or releases. These sessions capture what went well and what could be improved, resulting in actionable items that are tracked in the backlog. This feedback loop, combined with standardized templates for releases and incident communication, allows OctoAcme to refine its workflows and reduce single-person dependency risk over time.
